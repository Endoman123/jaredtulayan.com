During our junior year, me and my friend decided to run through a two-week program-building project that our
AP Java class did. During this time, we did some planning and decided to make a bullet hell in java. What came out
was *Hold My Coffee*, a simple bullet hell built using LibGDX.

This wasn't just a fun game that we decided to build; there were many things we were trying out and experimenting with:
trying out working with an [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), 
[spatial partitioning](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/spatial-partition.html) for collision checking, etc.
We learned a lot of things about writing state machines, working with ECS's, the 
features (and limitations) of different spatial partitioning methods, and even some basic art and design things.

*Hold My Coffee* holds a special place with me and my friend, and is often a reminder of where we've been, and where we
may be in the future.
