title: Mercury 1089 website
description: Mercury 1089's website, upgraded by me from 2017-2018

During my time in my high school's robotics team, I was taking up a lot of projects that involved coding.
Not all of these projects were involved with robots. Some, like this WordPress theme for my team, involved
web design and dynamic page APIs. 

This website was served using the WordPress framework. I was helping manage the website content,
but I also took it upon myself to upgrade the website theme by rebuilding it from the ground up. I guess it
isn't really an upgrade in that case, but it was still an improvement from the iteration before.

The website theme has broken a bit over the past two years,
but there is work being done by the current webdesign sub-committee to change the theme to work with a new
WordPress site builder.
