<p>Sometime in the summer before my senior year of college, I decided that my home network needed a well-needed makeover.
So with the help of some of my parents’ money, as well as some spare parts laying around the house, I built my home network
a full network stack. This was challenging, particularly because of a set of requirements that I wanted to fulfill:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unify all devices on the network in this stack</li>
  <li>Desaturate bandwidth</li>
  <li>Add networked storage for backup</li>
  <li>Host my game servers</li>
</ul>

<p>With this, I invested some money into TIA rails and built a server rack out of some 2x4s and caster wheels that were in
the makerspace. Having a rack that was movable made sense at the time because I didn’t know if we were ever going to renovate the house,
or if I ever needed to move the rack. In hindsight, I’d probably also want some female-to-female keystones that would allow me to easily remove
the cables.</p>

<p>I built a NAS for my family to store their photos and files. This was done with a combination of used 3TB WD Blue drives and an old Intel-based board.
While extremely convenient for everyone to be able to access those files whenever they need, I also wish we had better redundancy; the 3-2-1 method of 
storing backups would be good peace of mind in case the NAS hard drives fail. I also wish there was a bigger market for rackmounted ATX cases.</p>

<p>My game server is managed by Pterodactyl, a game server management panel and daemon. The panel, i.e.: frontend, is hosted on my personal VPS,
and the SuperMicro compute unit that I repurposed for this is the daemon. The server is a dual-cpu machine running two Intel Xeons, each with 6 cores and 12 threads,
and is loaded with 96GB of ECC-registered ram. The daemon machine is simply a docker host; The panel accesses this as a single node; If I really wanted to, I could have the
panel communicate with multiple nodes to spawn game servers on different machines.</p>

<p>Since my NAS is run with TrueNAS, I could run some other niceties. For instance, I am running a network-wide recursive DNS resolver through Pi-Hole, run as a virtual machine
on the TrueNAS system. This allows us to have DNS blocking, as well as cache DNS visits for faster access.</p>

<p>Finally, this is all routed through an eero mesh router and an unmanaged switch. Again, in hindsight, I should have taken a managed switch as having VLANs might have beena a
useful feature for isolating all of our IoT devices.</p>

<p>I hope to still add things to this stack; one such thing is a VPN so that my family and I can access this network wherever we are.</p>
