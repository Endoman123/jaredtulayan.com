I'm currently a student at Rutgers University, working towards a BS in Computer Science and a minor in music.

Outside of programming, I enjoy making things, whether that's music or guitars or other bits or bobs.

I am also working as a team member of the Rutgers Makerspace, where I help Rutgers students and staff operate machinery, design
3D prints, and maintain the Makerspace's machinery, tools, and area.
