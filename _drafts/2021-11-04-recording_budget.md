If you ever wanted to record audio but felt like there was no way you could get an 
isolation booth ready with how little money you have, this guide is probably for you. 
Audio recording and acoustic considerations can get really big, 
so for the sake of this guide, we will consider a simple isolation booth that is good for single-person recordings. 
This should cover voiceovers, simple instruments, or foley (sound effect recordings)

## Consider your Budget
One of the most important things to consider when designing anything is the budget you are willing to spend on it. 
This does not just mean how much money you are willing to spend on this project, 
but it also means how much you want to spend on each aspect of it. 
You could probably break your budget into these categories:

- Actual recording hardware (Interface, Mic)
- Acoustic material (acoustic foam pads, reflectors, etc.)
- DIY materials (hardware + tools you would use for mounting or building DIY acoustic solutions)

Depending on what you already have on you, what your space is like, among many other things, will change how you break down your budget between these three aspects. For this budget, a good start is 75-20-5. The following sections will explain why this breakdown is.
